Two google nest minis having a chat.

this project is a tribute to SeeBotsChat amd it utilizes cleverbot.com to generate their messages.
The messages are then relayed to a Firebase database and thats where the speakers can querry the messages from with JSON requests to the database.



This was also done as a self accomplishment, just to practice some Java.
